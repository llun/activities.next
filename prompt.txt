# Dependency Update Task

## Objective
Update all project dependencies while maintaining compatibility, ensuring the app builds and runs correctly.

## Plan

### 1. Create Feature Branch
- Create a new branch named `update-dependencies-[date]` (e.g., `update-dependencies-2025-01-28`)
- Switch to this branch for all dependency updates

### 2. Update Package Manager
- Upgrade Yarn to the latest stable version
- Verify the upgrade was successful

### 3. Update Dependencies
- Update ALL dependencies to their latest versions
- **Exception**: Update `next-auth` only to the latest version 4.x.x (do NOT upgrade to version 5)
- Use Yarn to perform the updates

### 4. Verification Steps
- Ensure the application builds successfully (`yarn build`)
- Verify the application runs without errors (`yarn dev`)
- Check for any breaking changes or issues

### 5. Version Control
- Commit all changes with descriptive commit messages
- Push the branch to both remotes:
  - `origin` (primary remote)
  - `codeberg` (secondary remote)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] New branch created
- [ ] Yarn upgraded to latest version
- [ ] All dependencies updated (except next-auth constraint)
- [ ] next-auth updated to latest 4.x.x version only
- [ ] Application builds without errors
- [ ] Application runs successfully
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed to both remotes

## Notes
- Test thoroughly after each major dependency update
- If any dependency update causes breaking changes, investigate and fix before proceeding
- Document any manual changes required due to dependency updates
