# SQLite Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Activity.next using SQLite as your database backend. SQLite is a great choice for development environments or small instances with limited traffic.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and Yarn
- Git (to clone the repository)

## Database Configuration

1. Set the `ACTIVITIES_DATABASE` environment variable with the following JSON configuration (stringify it first):

```json
{
  "type": "sql",
  "client": "better-sqlite3",
  "useNullAsDefault": true,
  "connection": {
    "filename": "./dev.sqlite3"
  }
}
```

You can also add this configuration to a `config.json` file in the root directory:

```json
{
  "database": {
    "type": "sql",
    "client": "better-sqlite3",
    "useNullAsDefault": true,
    "connection": {
      "filename": "./dev.sqlite3"
    }
  }
}
```

2. Run database migrations to set up the schema:

```bash
yarn migrate
```

This will execute all migration scripts in the [migrations directory](https://github.com/llun/activities.next/tree/main/migrations).

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/llun/activities.next.git
cd activities.next
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Configure the environment (in addition to database settings above):

Create a `config.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
  "host": "your-domain.tld",
  "secretPhase": "your-random-secret-for-sessions",
  "allowEmails": ["your-email@example.com"],
  "auth": {
    "github": {
      "id": "github-app-client-id",
      "secret": "github-app-secret"
    }
  }
}
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Using with a Tunnel for Local Development

To run Activity.next locally and communicate with other federated servers, you'll need a tunnel service that exposes your local server to the internet:

1. Set up a tunnel service like [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
2. Point the tunnel to localhost:3000
3. Use your tunnel's domain as the `host` in your configuration

## Production Deployment with SQLite

For production deployment with SQLite:

1. Make sure to place your SQLite database in a persistent directory
2. Consider using a more robust file locking mechanism
3. Implement regular database backups

Remember that SQLite is best suited for low to moderate traffic instances. For higher traffic or multi-server deployments, consider using PostgreSQL instead.

### Docker Deployment with SQLite

To deploy Activity.next with SQLite using Docker:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e ACTIVITIES_HOST=your.domain.tld \
  -e ACTIVITIES_SECRET_PHASE=random-secret-for-cookie \
  -e NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your.domain.tld \
  -e NEXTAUTH_SECRET=session-secret \
  -e ACTIVITIES_DATABASE_TYPE=sql \
  -e ACTIVITIES_DATABASE_CLIENT=better-sqlite3 \
  -e ACTIVITIES_DATABASE_SQLITE_FILENAME=/opt/activities.next/data.sqlite \
  -v /path/to/local/storage:/opt/activities.next \
  ghcr.io/llun/activities.next:latest
```

The `-v` option mounts a local directory to the container's `/opt/activities.next` directory, which allows the SQLite database to persist between container restarts. Make sure to create this directory with appropriate permissions beforehand.
