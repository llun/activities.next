# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `app/` contains the Next.js App Router UI and API routes (see `app/api/` and route groups like `app/(nosidebar)/`).
- `lib/` hosts core domain logic, database access, services, jobs, and shared utilities.
- `migrations/` holds Knex migration files used for SQL backends.
- `public/` serves static assets; `uploads/` and `data/` are used for local storage in some deployments.
- `docs/` includes setup and database-specific guides; `scripts/` includes repo utilities.
- Configuration files live at the repo root (for example `config.json` and `config.*.json`).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- **Agents:** MUST use Node.js version 24 for running any node commands in this project.
- **Always use `yarn` for all package management.** Never use `npm install`, `npm ci`, or any other `npm` commands to install or manage packages.
- `yarn dev` runs the local Next.js development server.
- `yarn build` builds the production app; `yarn start` serves it.
- `yarn lint` runs ESLint across the workspace.
- `yarn test` runs the full Jest suite (all tests run in parallel with SQLite in-memory databases).
- `yarn migrate` applies Knex migrations; `yarn migrate:make <name>` creates a new migration.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- TypeScript + React with 2-space indentation.
- Prettier enforces no semicolons, single quotes, and import sorting (`.prettierrc.yml`).
- Use absolute imports (for example `@/lib/...`) for anything outside the current directory.
- Relative imports are allowed only for files in the same directory (for example `./helper`), and `../` imports are not allowed.
- Apply the same import-path rule to `jest.mock(...)` module paths.
- ESLint (Next + TypeScript) runs via `yarn lint`; unused vars should be prefixed with `_`.
- Tests are co-located with code and named `*.test.ts`/`*.test.tsx`.

## Logging Guidelines

- **NEVER** use `console.log`, `console.warn`, `console.error`, or any `console.*` methods in committed code.
- Migration files in `migrations/` and script files in `scripts/` are exceptions and may use `console.*` for CLI output.
- For server-side code (API routes, services, jobs, models, lib utilities), use the logger from `@/lib/utils/logger`:

  ```typescript
  import { logger } from '@/lib/utils/logger'

  logger.info({ message: 'Something happened' })
  logger.warn({ message: 'Warning message' })
  logger.error({ message: 'Error occurred' })
  ```

- **Do NOT** use logger in React components or client-side code—logging is for server-side only.

## API Response Guidelines

- Always use `apiResponse` and `apiErrorResponse` from `@/lib/utils/response` for API route responses.
- **Do NOT** use `Response.json()` directly in API routes.
- On CORS-enabled endpoints (those that export `OPTIONS`), always use `apiResponse` — even for error responses — so CORS headers are included. Reserve `apiErrorResponse` for non-CORS routes or middleware.
- Example usage:

  ```typescript
  import {
    HTTP_STATUS,
    apiErrorResponse,
    apiResponse
  } from '@/lib/utils/response'

  // Success response
  return apiResponse({ req, allowedMethods: ['GET'], data: result })

  // Error response (non-CORS route)
  return apiErrorResponse(HTTP_STATUS.NOT_FOUND)

  // Error response (CORS-enabled route — include req and allowedMethods)
  return apiResponse({
    req,
    allowedMethods: CORS_HEADERS,
    data: { error: 'Bad Request' },
    responseStatusCode: 400
  })
  ```

## Zod Validation in API Routes

- **Always use `safeParse`**, never `.parse()`, in API route handlers. `.parse()` throws an unhandled `ZodError` that propagates as a 500; `safeParse` lets you return a proper 4xx response.
- For string columns with a database size limit (e.g. `varchar(255)`), add a matching `.max(255)` constraint in the Zod schema to prevent runtime DB errors.
- When a text column is nullable, use `.transform((v) => v || null)` to convert empty/whitespace-only strings to `null`. Keep this normalization consistent between create and update paths.

  ```typescript
  const UpdateNameRequest = z.object({
    name: z
      .string()
      .trim()
      .max(255)
      .transform((v) => v || null)
  })

  const parsed = UpdateNameRequest.safeParse(json)
  if (!parsed.success) {
    return apiResponse({
      req,
      allowedMethods: CORS_HEADERS,
      data: { error: 'Invalid input' },
      responseStatusCode: 422
    })
  }
  ```

## Settings Forms (Client Components)

- Settings forms that update user data (name, email, password, etc.) **must be client components** using `fetch()` with JSON bodies — not plain HTML `<form method="post">` with server-side redirects.
- This matches the pattern used by `ChangeEmailForm`, `ChangePasswordForm`, and `ChangeNameForm`.
- Client component forms should:
  - Call `fetch('/api/v1/...', { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, body: JSON.stringify(data) })`
  - Show inline success and error messages (not raw error pages)
  - Manage loading state with `useState`
- The corresponding API route should return JSON via `apiResponse()`, not `Response.redirect()`.

## Better-auth Plugin Guidelines

- **Do not register a better-auth plugin unless its required database tables exist** in the Knex migrations. The custom `knexAdapter` does not auto-create tables; missing tables will cause runtime errors.
- When adding a new plugin (e.g. `sso()`, `dash()`), first create the necessary migration with `yarn migrate:make <name>`, then register the plugin.
- Plugins that expose admin or dashboard endpoints must be configured with explicit access control (e.g. `adminCredentials` or `adminRole`). Never register `dash()` without authentication gating.

## Testing Guidelines

- Jest is configured via `jest.config.mjs` with SWC transforms.
- Prefer unit tests near `lib/` and route tests near `app/`.
- All tests run in parallel using isolated SQLite in-memory databases.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Commit messages must start with one of these prefixes followed by a short imperative description:
  - `none:` to mark that commit as no-release unless another commit in the range requests a higher bump
  - `major:` for breaking changes (major version bump)
  - `minor:` for backwards-compatible new features (minor version bump)
  - `fix:`, `feat:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, etc. for everything else (patch version bump)
- PRs should include a clear summary, linked issues (if any), test results, and notes for config/migrations.
- Include screenshots or clips for UI changes.

### Version Bump Prefixes

**Do NOT manually change the `version` field in `package.json`.** A CI workflow automatically bumps the version based on commit message prefixes after merge. Manual version changes in PRs will conflict with the automated workflow.

The version-bump workflow reads commit prefixes to determine the next semver version. Use these prefixes to control version bumping:

| Prefix               | Version bump    | When to use                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `none:`              | None            | Internal-only changes that should not cut a release. This marks that commit as no-bump, but `major:` or `minor:` in another commit still wins    |
| `major:`             | Major (`X.0.0`) | Breaking changes that require users to update configs, migrations, or integrations (e.g. removed API, changed auth flow, incompatible DB schema) |
| `minor:`             | Minor (`x.Y.0`) | New backwards-compatible features users can opt into (e.g. new endpoint, new UI page, new optional config)                                       |
| _(any other prefix)_ | Patch (`x.y.Z`) | Bug fixes, refactors, chores, docs, tests — anything that doesn't change the public-facing contract                                              |

Commits that change only files under `.github/` are also treated as no-bump by default, unless the commit message explicitly uses `major:` or `minor:`.

Examples:

```text
none: update internal CI docs without cutting a release
chore: tweak GitHub Actions cache keys              ← no bump if the commit only changes `.github/`
major: remove legacy v1 API endpoints
minor: add support for S3 media storage
fix: correct timestamp parsing in ActivityPub inbox   ← patch
chore: update dependencies                            ← patch
```

- **Before committing**, always run:
  1. `yarn run prettier --write .` to format all files.
  2. `yarn lint` to ensure no linting errors—**must be green before commit**.
  3. `yarn build` to ensure no build errors—**must be green before commit**.
  4. `yarn test` to ensure no test errors—**must be green before commit**.

## Security & Configuration Tips

- Store secrets and instance settings in `config.json` or environment variables; avoid committing secrets.
- Review `docs/setup.md` and the database setup guides before changing auth, host, or database settings.

## Database Backends & Local Setup

- Supported backends: SQLite (`docs/sqlite-setup.md`) and PostgreSQL (`docs/postgresql-setup.md`).
- Local SQLite is the simplest for development; run `yarn migrate` after updating schema or migrations.
- Tests use isolated SQLite in-memory databases for fast, parallel execution.
- Docker users should mount a persistent volume to `/opt/activities.next` (see `docs/setup.md`).

## Database Compatibility Guidelines

- **All database operations must work with both SQLite and PostgreSQL** (and potentially other SQL backends like MySQL).
- Use Knex query builder for all database operations—avoid raw SQL unless absolutely necessary.
- When writing raw SQL, ensure syntax is compatible across all supported databases.
- Avoid database-specific features unless wrapped with conditional logic for each backend.
- Test migrations and queries against SQLite (used in tests) to catch compatibility issues early.
- Use standard SQL types and avoid vendor-specific extensions (e.g., use `text` instead of PostgreSQL's `varchar[]`).
